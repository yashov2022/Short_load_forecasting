# Short_load_forecasting
This is the project I did as part of my Internship in National Institute Of Technology Calicut.
This project involves enhancing short-term load forecasting (STLF) through a hybrid multi-zone approach. The algorithm integrates the shift method, leveraging the temporal patterns of historical load data. Multiple time series and machine learning models were explored and implemented to improve forecasting accuracy across different zones.

Key Methods and Algorithms Used:

ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)

LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory networks)

Bi-LSTM (Bidirectional LSTM)

SVR (Support Vector Regression)

RBF (Radial Basis Function networks)
